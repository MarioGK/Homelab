# Advanced Caddy Configuration for Public Services
# This file demonstrates how to configure public routing with additional features

# Example: Enable HTTPS with automatic certificate generation
# Uncomment and modify as needed

# Example public service with HTTPS:
# media.mariogk.com {
#   reverse_proxy 192.168.5.10:8096 {
#     header_up X-Forwarded-Host {host}
#     header_up X-Forwarded-Proto {scheme}
#     header_up X-Real-IP {remote_ip}
#   }
# }

# Example with basic authentication:
# admin.mariogk.com {
#   basicauth / {
#     admin hashedpassword
#   }
#   reverse_proxy 192.168.5.10:3000
# }

# Example with rate limiting and health checks:
# api.mariogk.com {
#   reverse_proxy 192.168.5.10:5000 {
#     health_uri /health
#     health_interval 10s
#     health_timeout 5s
#   }
# }

# For production setup, consider:
# 1. Setting up proper DNS records pointing to your public IP
# 2. Configuring firewall rules to allow specific ports
# 3. Using authentication for sensitive services
# 4. Enabling HTTPS with proper certificates
# 5. Setting up rate limiting and DDoS protection
